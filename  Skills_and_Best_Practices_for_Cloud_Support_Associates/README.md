# Module 4: Customer Support Techniques 
## Troubleshooting Methodologies
In the previous video, you learned about the 50/50 troubleshooting method. Below you can find information about other troubleshooting methods. This is not a complete list, but instead should give you some ideas on how to structure your thoughts and process when troubleshooting issues with customers.

### The Divide and Conquer Method
The divide and conquer method is very similar to the 50/50 method. This approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts and isolating each part for analysis. If you are troubleshooting a large and complex system you may be working with a team. Support teams tackle each component independently, identifying any issues and ruling out potential causes iteratively until the root cause is identified.  Let’s run through an example.

**Problem:** The web application is experiencing intermittent downtime.

**Divide the problem space**

First, you would divide the problem into two main areas: server-side issues and client-side issues.

**Investigate server-side issues**

  - **Server Infrastructure:** You start by investigating the server infrastructure to determine if there are any hardware or network issues causing downtime.

  - **Application Code:** You review the application code and server-side configurations to identify any bugs, memory leaks, or performance issues.

  - **Database:** You look into the database server to ensure it is properly configured and able to handle the incoming requests  efficiently.

**Investigate client-side issues**

  - **Network Connectivity:** You check for any network connectivity issues on the client side that may be causing intermittent connection failures.

  - **Browser Compatibility:** You then verify if the web application is compatible with different browsers and devices, making sure that users aren't experiencing issues due to browser-specific issues.

  - **Cache and Cookies:** You inspect the client-side cache and cookies to determine if there is any cached content that is causing the issues. It’s common to clear browser cookies and cache when troubleshooting the client-side.

**Narrow down potential causes**

After investigating both server-side and client-side issues, you should analyze the data to narrow down potential causes of the intermittent downtime.

### The Five Whys
The Five Whys troubleshooting method really encourages you to dive deeper until you find the root cause of the issue. This method involves you repeatedly asking why until you reach the root cause of the issue. This can help guide your troubleshooting efforts as you think through what could be causing the issue. Let’s run through an example.

**Problem:** a web application is running slow. 

1. **Why** is the web application running slow? Because the response time for the page loads is unusually high.

2. **Why** is the response time for page loads unusually high?Because the server is taking longer than usual to process requests.

3. **Why** is the server taking longer than usual to respond to requests?Because the database queries run by the application are inefficient and result in slow data retrieval.

4. **Why** are the database queries inefficient?Because the database schema is not optimized, leading to inefficient query execution.

5. **Why** is the database schema not optimized?Because the application was initially designed for a smaller scale and didn't account for the growing volume of data and user traffic, resulting in suboptimal database indexing and query performance.

By asking **why** repeatedly, we've identified a deeper issue. The application's database schema was not designed to handle the increased data volume and user traffic, leading to inefficient query performance. To address the slow performance of the web application, it's essential to optimize the database schema, improve query efficiency, and possibly scale up the infrastructure to accommodate the growing demand.

### The Bottom-Up Method
In t  - his approach, troubleshooting starts at the lowest level components of the system and moves upwards towards the higher-level components. For example, when troubleshooting an application issue, you might start by checking the underlying infrastructure, such as server resources and network connectivity, before examining the application itself. Let’s run through an example. 

**Problem:** A cloud-based file-sharing application is experiencing slow upload speeds.

**Start at the lowest level**

You begin by examining the network infrastructure closest to the user, such as their local network setup and internet connection.

**Investigate network connectivity**

  - **Local Network:** You check if there are any issues with the customers local network, like network slow downs, network rule configuration problems, or hardware issues.

  - **Internet Service Provider**: You verify the user's internet connection to ensure it meets the expected upload speed requirements and troubleshoot any issues with the ISP if necessary. This should eliminate the possibility that the slow upload speed is on the customer side.

**Examine device-specific factors**

  - **User Device Issues:** Everyone is using a device to connect to the file sharing application. So, you investigate if the user's device ( computer, smartphone) has any hardware or software limitations that could affect upload performance, such as outdated network drivers, insufficient processing power, or background processes consuming bandwidth.

  - **Browser Compatibility:** You also assess if the web browser being used by the user is optimized for file uploads and if any browser extensions or plugins are interfering with the upload process. You can usually inspect network traffic directly in the browser by using right click - inspect. You can also see if the browser is throwing any errors in the console.

**Analyze application-level factors**

  - **File-sharing Application:** You examine the cloud-based file-sharing application's server infrastructure, including server load, storage capacity, and network bandwidth availability.

  - **Application Code:** You review the application code to identify any inefficiencies or bottlenecks in the upload process, such as excessive data validation, or inefficient file chunking.

**Narrow down potential causes**

After investigating network connectivity, device-specific factors, and application-level factors, you analyze the collected data to narrow down potential causes of the slow upload speeds.

### The Top-Down Method
This one is like the opposite of the bottom-up method. The top-down method begins at the highest level of the system components and drills down to lower-level components. You start by assessing the overall system behavior or user-reported symptoms and then narrow down the potential causes by analyzing system components.

**Problem:** The cloud-based email service is experiencing intermittent delivery delays.

**Start with the highest level**

You begin by assessing the overall behavior of the email service and the reported symptoms of intermittent delivery delays.

**Check service-level factors**

  - **Email Service Status:** Check the status of the email service to determine if there are any widespread outages or service disruptions affecting delivery performance.

  - **Server Load:** Evaluate the server infrastructure's overall load and performance metrics to identify any spikes in activity or resource bottlenecks that may be contributing to delays.

  - **Service Logs:** Review service logs and monitoring data to identify patterns or anomalies in email delivery times and pinpoint periods of slow performance.

**Investigate application-level factors**

  - **Email Routing:** Analyze the email routing process within the application to identify potential bottlenecks or misconfigurations that could delay message delivery. Check delivery logs if they exist.

  - **Email Filters:** Assess the performance of spam filters and virus scanners integrated into the email service to ensure they are not causing delays due to excessive processing times or false positives.

**Analyze user-specific factors**

  - **User Settings and Preferences:** Investigate if individual user settings or preferences, such as email forwarding rules are impacting message delivery times.

  - **Recipient Mail Servers:** Check the performance and responsiveness of recipient mail servers to determine if delays are occurring on the recipient's end rather than within the email service itself.

  - **Network Latency:** Assess network latency and connectivity issues between the email service and recipient mail servers that may be causing delays in message transmission.

**Narrow down potential causes**

After analyzing service-level factors, application-level factors, and user-specific factors, narrow down potential causes of the intermittent delivery delays.
